# Sentiment-Analyzer

## Abstract

Provided some synthetic twitter data in a csv file named twitter_data.csv which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. We have also words that express positive sentiment and negative sentiment, in the files positive_words.txt and negative_words.txt. 
We built a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. We then created a csv file, which contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score, Negative Score and the Net Score for each tweet. At the end, we upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets, and produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.

## Output

The program will generate a new CSV file named resulting_data.csv in the same folder where the program is executed. It contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score, Negative Score, and the Net Score for each tweet.

resulting_data.csv

Then after opening the CSV file and inserting a graph between Net Score vs Number
of Retweets we get the following result:
